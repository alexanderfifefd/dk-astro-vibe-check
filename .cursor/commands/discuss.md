# Discussion Command

Start a focused discussion on a specific topic that warrants deeper exploration than fits in a project's `description.md`.

## When to Use
- The topic requires back-and-forth exploration
- The conversation would overwhelm the project description
- You want to preserve the reasoning process, not just the conclusion

## Process
1. **Create the discussion file:**
    - Where directed to. 
2. **Document the discussion** as it unfolds. Capture:
   - The question or problem being explored
   - Key arguments and counterarguments
   - Conclusions reached (if any)
3. **Do NOT auto-load** these in familiarize—they are reference material, not active context.
4. **Link from description.md** if the discussion produced decisions:
   ```markdown
   ## Key Decisions
   - **[Topic]:** [Decision]
       - **Context:** See `discussions/[topic_slug].md`
   ```

## Note
Discussions are human-initiated. The AI does not start discussions unprompted—the human creates the file and asks the AI to engage.
